            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am transitioning from a non-tech role to a frontend development career, with expertise in React and TypeScript.As a Microsoft-certified and experienced BI analyst in banking operations and
                process improvement. I possess a proven track record of success in driving
                data-driven decisions and maximizing corporate values through bespoke
                dashboard building, process mapping, agile project management, data
                analytics, and web development.I am experienced in developing and deploying
                custom dashboards, programming, and ETL processes to help stakeholders
                make informed decisions. I handled a multi-client project for the operations
                department to centralize everything into one location, which resulted in less
                time for training, operation excellence, and people awareness. I am now seeking
                a managerial role to lead a full-time project for a forward thinking firm</p>
           
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I have completed Post Graduation in Computer application From MS University of Baroda in 2020. Currently I am pursuinh Master of computer application from GLA university.</p>
           
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I like Programming, tech blogging, and UI/UX design exploration.</p>
